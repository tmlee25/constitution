# Preamble

We, the undergraduates, graduate students, and resident faculty of Avery, in order to create a more perfect Avery that is open, fair, and diverse, that is supportive and encourages the pursuit of knowledge without fear of ridicule or peer pressure, and that is a gathering place for creative, integrous, and tenacious people and their posterity (pre-Averites), do hereby ordain and establish this Constitution for the community of Avery.

# Article 1. Membership and Dues

## 1.1. Avery Membership

Membership in Avery may be established in the following ways:

1.	Residency. Anyone living in Avery will automatically become a Full Member of Avery for the duration of their residency. Prospective students, students who have not yet completed rotation, and summer students are excluded from automatic Membership.
2.	Membership Petition. Anyone, including those that have never lived in Avery, wishing to become a Full or Social member must inform the Secretary, who will send an online membership petition form out to the House. Membership is granted when the candidate receives 10 “yes” votes from current Full members of Avery. In exceptional circumstances, ExComm reserves the right to deny membership by a unanimous vote. A social member wishing to become a full member also needs to pass a House membership petition by receiving at least 10 “yes” votes. New members may directly petition to become a full member without applying for a social membership.

The membership of Avery at any time is limited to current Residents and current students of Caltech.


### 1.1.1. Dropping Membership

Non-resident Members wishing to drop their membership or switch between a full and social member must notify the Secretary in writing. Membership is not automatically dropped by a Member terminating their residency in Avery if that person remains a current student of Caltech. Resident Members who did not pick into Avery through the internal lottery may also drop membership by notifying the Secretary in writing.

## 1.2. Avery Dues

There will be two tiers of membership: 
FULL and SOCIAL. 

The rights granted are as follows:

1.	Attend subsidized social events : ALL
2.	Contribute to Avery’s mailing lists: ALL
3.	Vote on matters put before Avery: FULL ONLY
4.	Participate in Avery internal housing lottery : FULL ONLY
5.	Run for any Avery officer position: FULL ONLY

There will be three classes of dues-paying members: Social members, associate members, and non-associate full members. Associate members are defined as the subset of full members who do not have Avery listed as their primary house. Associate members will pay separate dues rates, and will have dues directly collected from them by the House.

Note: Full membership dues are now $90 but are covered by the Institute, so there is, as before, no out of pocket amount paid by full members. Associate membership dues are $45 out of pocket, the current rate for dual members, and social membership dues are $30. Hence, the amount of money paid out of pocket by all types of members will remain the same.

The dues rates are as follows:
	NON-ASSOCIATE FULL Members: $90
	ASSOCIATE Members: $45
	SOCIAL Members: $35

If the Institute changes the amount of dues money covered for members, then ExComm may reduce the dues rate accordingly for a single term. Permanent changes to dues must require a successful constitutional amendment.

## 3.2 Voting Procedure

The voting period on any vote brought before House Members will be specified by the ExComm or petition bringing forth the vote, but may not be more than 7 days. The motion or petition must also specify whether and how the voting period may be extended in the case that a quorum is not reached; but in no case may the total period of voting exceed the 7-day maximum.

### 3.2.2. Online Voting Procedure

If an official house vote is to be held using an online voting system, it must abide by the following:

## 3.3 Voting System

A selective vote is defined as a vote with multiple choices. For each selective vote, a voter will rank the choices in order of descending preference, with rank one being the most preferred. For each rank, the voter may select one of the choices on the ballot, or may leave the rank blank. There will also be a choice for NO, which will run as a candidate. If NO wins a vote, then the election for that specific candidate is considered invalid and must be redone in a new vote. In the new vote, NO will not be a candidate. A ballot conforming to these guidelines will be considered correctly cast. The winner(s) of a selective vote is declared as follows: 
1.	Ballots are counted according to first rank votes. If one choice gets a majority of the votes then it wins.
2.	If no winner has been declared, the choice with the fewest votes will be eliminated, and each of that choice's ballots will be redistributed among the choices by the next available choice ranked. This process will be repeated until one choice gets a majority of the votes. 
3.	Ties among last place choices will be resolved by the following process: the votes of one of the tied choices will be redistributed, and the count process is continued until a potential winner is found. 
4.	This will be repeated for each of the other tied choices, until all such potential winners are found. If the same choice emerges as the potential winner in all cases, then that choice is declared the winner; if the election allows for multiple winners not running on the same ticket, then this candidate is declared the first winner. If no consensus is found, then all correctly cast ballots will be reorganized and counted according to preferences for only the potential winners, using the procedure outlined above, and the choice receiving an absolute majority of the votes will be declared the winner. If a tie occurs among all remaining choices, the vote will be ruled indeterminate, and another vote will be held at the earliest possible opportunity.
5.	If the election allows for multiple winners not running on the same ticket, and a first winner was determined in step 4, this winner will be removed from the voting results, and for each voter, every candidate whose rank was higher than the first winner will have their rank decreased by one in that voter’s record; steps 1-4 will then be repeated to determine a second winner in the election. If step 4 results in an indeterminate vote, any winners already determined will be declared and only the remaining candidates will be on the ballot to determine the additional winners.
6.	Step 5 will be repeated however many times necessary to determine all winners for the election, provided that step 4 does not result in an indeterminate vote.

## 3.4. Elections 

Elections will be held during the second term for all Officer positions.

## 3.5. Vote of No Confidence

A vote of no confidence against an Officer of Avery may be brought before the Members for negligence of their duties as set forth in this Constitution. If the vote of no confidence is confirmed by a two thirds referendum vote of the Members, the Officer's position is immediately revoked.
